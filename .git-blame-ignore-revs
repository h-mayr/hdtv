# This file lists commits that should be ignored by `git blame`.
# Usually, these are automated mass-changes that fix code style,
# white space or formatting in general.
#
# To use it, pass `--ignore-revs-file .git-blame-ignore-revs` as a flag
# to `git blame`. You can make this a default for your repo:
#   git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
#
# By default, `git blame` will not use this file; the filename is
# just a convention.

# Addition of pre-commit hooks

# Additional fixes for black version 23.1.0
